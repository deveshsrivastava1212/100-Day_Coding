Problem- Reverse Nodes in K Group in LL
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/

Problem Statement-
                Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
                k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes 
                is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

                You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

                Example 1:
                Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
                Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Function-

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
        if(head == NULL || k==1)
            return head;
        ListNode *dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;

        ListNode *cur = dummy, *nex = dummy, *pre = dummy;
        int count =0;
        while(cur->next != NULL)
        {
            cur = cur->next;
            count ++;
        }
        while(count >= k)
        {
            cur = pre->next;
            nex = cur->next;
            for(int i=1;i<k;i++)
            {
                cur->next = nex->next;
                nex->next = pre->next;
                pre->next = nex;
                nex = cur->next;
            }
            pre = cur;
            count -= k;
        }
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
